## üëã Welcome!

This repo is the central hub for my **#AIAugustAppADay Challenge**:  
**21 weekdays, 21 AI-powered projects in August 2025.**

My goal: a deep dive into the new world of AI, expanding skills and making discoveries one day at a time.



## ü¶æ What's the challenge?

Throughout August 2025, I‚Äôm building a new AI-powered project **every weekday**.  
Projects span frontend, backend, and full stack using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Python, and various AI APIs.  

Each project is open-source, documented, and (where possible) deployed for you to try. Each day will go a little something like this:

1. I'll start the project each day by creating a new repo from the template I made for this project, the [Next.js TypeScript Mantine starter](https://github.com/davedonnellydev/nextjs-typescript-mantine-starter). Most of the projects will be a Next.js/TypeScript project using Mantine UI components for quick and easy styling. There's one Python project currently in the mix and that will use the [Flask Python starter](https://github.com/davedonnellydev/flask-python-starter)
2. After the project's repo has been created, I'll define it's MVP features, tools/APIs to be used, sketch out basic user flow in the README file
3. Once the aims and user flow have been defined, then it's build time! UI components, API integration, app logic and testing. UI polishing if there's time.
4. I'll record my progress throughout the day and the last hour of the day will be dedicated to putting the video together, reflecting on learnings, tidying up the README and posting!


You can take a look at the challenges I'll be tackling throughout August below:
